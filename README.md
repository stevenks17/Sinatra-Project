# Sinatra Film Reviews

Sinatra Film Reviews is a Web App that lets a user sign up and login and create/edit and delete reviews. 
 
## Installation

Cloning the repo  and running bundle install in your terminal is needed to run the server and access the application. Once all gems are installed you will need to run shotgun to start the server. Doing so will populate your terminal with the server start code and a IP address will allow you to ctrl click itself and open the web app in your browser.

```bash
bundle install
```

```bash
shotgun
```

## Usage

The web app can be used as a base domain to create a application that will accept user input and show user input giving the ability to edit or delete their reviews solely to the object creator.

## Roadmap

In the future the application may be updated with the stretch goal of allowing all users of the app to comment on any posted work regardless of ownership
